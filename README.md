# super-super-simple-classification


Wanna classify text? Seems like you should be able to without learning about some crazy function like  `(m,b)=1N∑i=1n(yi−(mxi+b))2` right!

Thats what I think too‼️

super-super-simple-classification is a project that aims to make this as easy as possible! No math needed, no insights to how the human brain works. Just good ol' repurposing of some of Googles work and useful Python libraries.
